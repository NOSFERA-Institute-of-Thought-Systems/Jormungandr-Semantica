## Guiding Principle

> Every empirical result must be supported by a theoretical claim, and every theoretical claim must be tested by a rigorous empirical or synthetic experiment. No compromise on reproducibility, rigor, or ambition.

## Abstract

JÃ¶rmungandr-Semantica is a research initiative aimed at developing novel methods for document clustering and semantic representation by leveraging the geometry of data manifolds. We hypothesize that by modeling text corpora as high-dimensional point clouds and analyzing their structure with graph wavelets, we can produce more robust and interpretable topic models than current state-of-the-art methods.

This website serves as a public research log, documenting our theoretical foundations, engineering challenges, and empirical results as they unfold.

### Project Status: Phase 1 Complete

We have successfully concluded the first phase of our research, establishing the superiority of our baseline geometric pipeline over strong modern alternatives.
